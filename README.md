Since Apple uses its own hardware, the Apple silicon, Apple reduces the support of the old hardware such as Broadcom WiFi/BT chipset.

This makes the machine not that flawlessly work as much as the native one does, so as far as I know all the Hackintosh machines using macOS 14 have a minor bug even if it is not that noticeable.

> Maybe it is not, there could be someone who uses a perfect Hackintosh with macOS 14, if so you can find him.

So I think The bugs will increase as time goes on, and it is definite unless Apple starts to support Intel CPU again ðŸ˜“

For this reason, I gave up Hackintosh-ing my main machine and will stop maintaining this Hackintosh EFI repo.

Thank you ðŸ˜ƒ

# Raptor Lake Hackintosh EFI

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8894bcf-e9d4-49d0-96e7-fae14bcf15ad)


## What is this

This repository contains the EFI directory of Intel RaptorLake i5-13490F and Gigabyte B760M Aorus Elite AX5 combo, with somewhat diverse additional components.

## Specification of my computer

## EFI structure

### WARNING

- I recommend you use this as only a reference resource
  - Obviously, this build may not be the best one
  - This EFI contains additional kexts in **config.plist** rather than only the essential things for B760M + RaptorLake CPU. You should remove them before using this on your PC

### Check this before you use

#### Generate your platform information

In the [config.plist](EFI/OC/config.plist) file, I've replaced the private serial codes into the `EDIT_HERE` words because to keep my personal information safe.

So if you are going to use this, you have to make sure that the `EDIT_HERE` texts are changed to yours. To generate the serial key, please refer to the [Dortania's OpenCore Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/AMD/zen.html#platforminfo). When you are about to generate one, you should select `iMacPro1,1` to properly use your machine.

> - If your CPU has less than 8 cores, go to `config.plist` file and find **PlatformInfo->Generic** and change the `ProcessorType` from `3841` to `1537`
> - If you want to change the CPU name, check this link and edit your `config.plist` file using [CPU-Name](https://github.com/corpnewt/CPU-Name)

#### About the Above 4G Decoding option in BIOS

In my setup, I disabled **Above 4G Decoding** in my BIOS and added `npci=0x2000` to the boot args because it doesn't boot with that option enabled.

If you want to use my EFI setup, you have to check whether this option enabled or not, if you want to enable **Above 4G Decoding** then you should remove that `npci=0x2000` arguments from the `boot-args`.

## What works and what doesn't work

### Works

- Everything excepts ...

### Doesn't work

- Apple continuity
  - Currently AX210 WiFi supports on macOS is immature yet
  - Sadly, Fenvi T919 (BCM94360) doesn't work on Sonoma
    - Seems like there is workaround but not stable, [check this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/170q5wu/enable_wifi_in_sonoma_with_fenvi_t919/)

## Refer to this as much as you want

But if you want to post your EFI somewhere else, please leave this repository link as a reference.

Thank you :smile:
